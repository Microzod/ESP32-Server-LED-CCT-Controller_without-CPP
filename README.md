# ESP32-Server-LED-CCT-Controller_without-CPP
====================
Application to control my living-room LED light fixture.

These files contain a project(WORK IN PROGRESS, non functioning) which creates a local web-page called esp.lan
through which a ESP32 receives parameters that are used by the ESP32 to control the color temperature, intensity and automatic turn-ON/turn-OFF of a LED light fixture in my living-room.

The LED light fixture is built with the following parts:
¤ - 1 single 1120 mm LED strip
  - Bridgelux® Vesta™ Tunable Linear Gen 3 Thrive 2 SMD Rows - featuring 2700K 3-Step MacAdam Ellipse & 5000K 3-Step MacAdam Ellipse LEDs.
